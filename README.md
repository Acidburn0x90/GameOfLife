# John Conway's Game of Life
***A Python Implementation***
*Created by the RCHS Cyber Club Team*


**What is needed to create our game?**
-
- An IDE
- Understanding of Python Basics
- Knowledge of how John Conway's Game of Life works

**What is an IDE?**
-
- An IDE is, analogously, a fancy text editor. It's like a word processor, but specifically designed for writing code. It has features that make writing code easier, like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools.
 
 **Why use an IDE?**
 -
 - We use IDEs like GitHub's Codespaces and Jupyter Notebooks because they streamline the program development process. IDEs offer a suite of tools that not only execute our code but also assist in debugging, visualizing output, and connecting with a wider community of developers. This shared platform fosters a collaborative environment where solutions to common programming challenges are readily available.

**What is Python and what can it do?**
-
- Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language. It emphasizes readability, making it a great choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. It has a simple syntax and versatility. Python is just like any other programming language meaning that it can anything any other language can do. But python clearly excels and falls behind other languages in certain tasks.
- Python differs from most languages because it is an interpreted language and not compiled. It is mostly used for data science and visualization.The largest piece of criticism comes from the fact that, compared to other languages, python is deemed as a very slow language.

**What is John Conway's Game of Life?**
-
- John Conway’s Game of Life is a form of cellular Automaton. A cellular automaton is a mathematical models that describe a grid of cells that update their state in discrete time steps, based on the state of their neighbors and a set of rules.

**Why is it so important?**
- The Game of Life is so special because it is Turing Complete, meaning that it can create or replicate ANY Turing machine; where a Turing machine, without getting into its complex implications and definitions, is any mathematical model that represents how a computer functions. This means that the game of life can be “coded” to create ANY program or function.

**Rules of Conway's Game of Life**
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (under-population).
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).
